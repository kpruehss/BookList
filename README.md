# Book-list App

### Overview

This is a tutorial app where I introduce functionality provided by Redux into a
simple SPA with a hard-coded booklist.

Redux is utilized to manage the application state when it comes to selecting a
book from the book list and display details about the selection (this is where
state-change occurs.)
